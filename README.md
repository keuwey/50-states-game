# 50 states game

Project made for study purposes of the pandas library. It consists of a quiz where you have to try to get the name of the 50 states of the United States right.

If you can't get the name of all 50 states right, a csv file will be generated with the name of all the states you forgot so you can train later. But if you do get all the 50 states name right, well, then you win the game haha.
